# manage-gmail-labels

This is a python command line tool to manage Gmail labels, i.e. creating, deleting, removing. It does not perform any operations over emails as of yet, but these can be considered in the future.

This work was created as a pet project and a way to practice Python (https://docs.python.org/3/library/) and Gmail Client Libraries API (e.g. https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/users/labels) Actual code was much imported from the Gmail API Examples provided.
